Scripts to reproduce results of benchmark and the inverse design case study. 

Developed by Hang Xiao 2023.04 xiaohang007@gmail.com https://github.com/xiaohang007

Training datasets and results of the inverse design study are available in https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22707472.

## How to use:

### 1. General_setup:
Put Materials Project's new API key in "APIKEY.ini". 

Edit "CPUs" in "slurm.conf" to set up the number of CPU threads available for the docker container.

Put this folder's absolute path in "[]" in "rundocker.sh" to setup share folder for the docker container.

Download SLICES_docker.tar.gz.* from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22707946 with pre-installed SLICES and other relevant packages. 
```bash
cat SLICES_docker.tar.gz.* | tar xzvf -  # Uncompress SLICES_docker.tar.gz.*

#### !!! Note that VASP should be installed and POTCAR should be set up for pymatgen using "pmg config -p <EXTRACTED_VASP_POTCAR> <MY_PSP>" before performing this task. Because VASP is a commercial software, it is not installed in the docker image provided.

```bash
cd /crystal/HTS/9_EAH_Band_gap_PBE
cp /crystal/HTS/7_EAH_prescreen/competitive_compositions.json.gz ./
python 1_splitRun.py # wait for jobs to finish (using qstat to check)
python 2_collect_clean_glob_details.py
python 3_filter.py # check results_7_EAH_prescreenfiltered_0.05eV.csv for details of promising candidates; check ./candidates for band structures
```
