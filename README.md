Developed by Hang Xiao 2023.04 xiaohang007@gmail.com https://github.com/xiaohang007
All results are available in the link mentioned in the paper: "SLICES: An Invertible, Symmetry-invariant, and String-based Crystallographic Representation".

How to use:

1. General_setup:
Put Materials Project's new API key in APIKEY.ini. 
Edit "CPUs" in slurm.conf to set up the number of CPU threads available for the docker container.
Put this folder's absolute path in "[]" in rundocker.sh to setup share folder for the docker container.
# run the docker container with pre-installed SLICES and other relevant packages, allowing easy installation and reproduction of the reconstruction benchmark and inverse design case study 
sh rundocker.sh
