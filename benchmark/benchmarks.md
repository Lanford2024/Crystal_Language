## Reproduction of benchmarks
Reproduction of benchmarks and inverse design case study using a docker image [as an example]. One can run these calculaitons without the docker environment but one need to edit the *.pbs files to make sure the job management system on your PC/HPC work.
### General setup
Download this repo and unzipped it.

Put Materials Project's new API key in "APIKEY.ini". 

Edit "CPUs" in "slurm.conf" to set up the number of CPU threads available for the docker container.

```bash
docker pull xiaohang07/slices:v9   # Download SLICES_docker with pre-installed SLICES and other relevant packages. 
# Make entrypoint_set_cpus.sh executable 
sudo chmod +x entrypoint_set_cpus.sh
# Repalce "[]" with the absolute path of this repo's unzipped folder to setup share folder for the docker container.
docker run  -it --privileged=true -h workq --gpus all --shm-size=0.1gb  -v /[]:/crystal -w /crystal xiaohang07/slices:v9 /crystal/entrypoint_set_cpus.sh
```
